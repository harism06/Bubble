# Bubble

## uh oh, the robots!! ü§ñ
I wrote an earlier post about Artificial Intelligence called, "AI" where I encouraged you to follow your heart instead of the crowd. Good read btw, highly recommend it. Anyways... I recently watched a video of Peter Thiel, cofounder of PayPal and Palantir, and he mentioned that whenever you see buzzwords, you should immediately think of fraud and run away as fast as you can. He mentions companies that say their product is "enterprise SaaS" and it uses "big data" with "cloud computing". Now this interview was conducted before the OpenAI released ChatGPT so AI wasn't a buzzword yet.

## Be wary üòê
Now, however, I have seen AI plastered over every startup description I come across which raises great caution. Now I am not saying that implementing AI in your startup is necessarily a bad thing but it is a buzzword. Buzzwords almost always have the impression of trying to catch someone's eyes, whether it is a recruiter for a job you're seeking or investors trying to get them to invest in your company. So imo, buzzwords should be avoided to improve clarity. Now if everyone has have strong belief in AI, eventually AI will not exactly meet their expectations. Hence the bubble. In 2008, the was the dot com crash because of the dot com bubble where everyone believed in the internet and how it was going to change the world. Eventually, too many people were betting on the internet too much which resulted in the crash. I have a prediction that we will be going to an AI crash and I don't know how soon it will be but it is coming.

## A softball quote üí¨
I want to conclude with a statement by well-known investor, Warren Buffet, "When others are greedy, be fearful. When others are fearful, be greedy."
